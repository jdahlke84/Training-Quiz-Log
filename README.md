# Training-Quiz-Log

This is a quiz log I created to be used within a company to keep track of employee quiz results and gather information to determine KPI and trending results. Macros and VBA was used to create this file. 
I created quizzes with the information going left to right on the forms - Quiz Title / Revision # / Employee Name / Employee ID / Date / Department / Shift / Score / Q1 / Q2 / Q3 / etc.... (all the way to Q75)

VBA is customizable

<strong> EE list </strong> - imports a list of employees based on where it's designed to pull from

<strong> Quiz Data Converter </strong> - Paste general quiz results in cell B4 and 'press to configure data' <p>

<strong> Trending Results </strong> - Trending results for each quiz is populated here. Quiz information can be changed based on the dropdown box. This will show how many questions were answered correctly and the percentage correctly answered. You can also filter to show the top 5 answered correctly and the top 5 answered incorrectly. These types of results can be shown to the employees
  
<strong> Training List </strong> - Each employee and their information is populated here based on which quiz is selected in the drop down box. This doesn't need to be populated. 

<strong> Questions </strong> - Each quiz can have the infomration populated in here. This is where you would populate the quiz information. 

<strong> Training Dump </strong> - This is the main area where all of the training records are stored. Quiz information from the 'Quiz Data Converter' sheet gets stored here.
